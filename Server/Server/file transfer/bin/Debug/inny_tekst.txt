In the early 1700s, French chemist Charles François du Fay found that if a charged gold-leaf is repulsed by glass rubbed with silk, 
then the same charged gold-leaf is attracted by amber rubbed with wool. From this and other results of similar types of experiments, 
du Fay concluded that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous fluid from glass rubbed with silk and resinous fluid from amber rubbed with wool. These two fluids can 
neutralize each other when combined.[15][16] American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion.[17]:118 A decade later Benjamin Franklin 
proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (−). He gave them the modern charge
 nomenclature of positive and negative respectively.[18] Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation 
was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.
